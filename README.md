# SAMF: Semantic Ambiguity Modeling Framework

Official implementation of **"Modeling Semantic Ambiguity: A Knowledge-Driven Framework for Security Attack Technique Extraction"**

## Overview

SAMF is a knowledge-driven framework for ATT&CK Technique extraction that addresses semantic ambiguity through structured textual knowledge. The framework leverages LLMs to automatically discover disambiguation knowledge and applies it through a two-stage classification process.
